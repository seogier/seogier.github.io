        <h1>Stephen E. Ogier</h1>
        <p>I'm a MRI Systems Engineer. I'm presently a research associate at <a href = 'https://www.kcl.ac.uk/bmeis/our-departments/perinatal-imaging-health'>King's College London</a>. I did my PhD in the <a href="https://www.tamu-mrsl.org/">Magnetic Resonance Systems Lab</a> at Texas A&M University.</p>
        <p>My interests include developing novel add-on systems to increase the capabilities of existing MRI scanners and developing low-cost standalone MR systems. I've built the occasional coil or array, but I've been fortunate to work with very tallented colleagues who truly make an art out of building coils.</p>
        <p>I also write occasional posts for <a href="https://hackaday.com/author/stephenogier/">Hackaday</a>.</p>
